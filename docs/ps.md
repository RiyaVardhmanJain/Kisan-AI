Post-Harvest Storage Inefficiency and Supply Chain Losses A significant portion of agricultural produce in India is lost after harvest due to inadequate storage infrastructure, poor environmental monitoring, fragmented warehouse management, and lack of real-time inventory visibility.
A significant portion of agricultural produce in India is lost after harvest due to inadequate storage infrastructure, poor environmental monitoring, fragmented warehouse management, and lack of real-time inventory visibility.

Farmers and aggregators often face:

* Absence of temperature and humidity monitoring

* Overstocking or underutilization of storage units

* Limited traceability of stored produce

* Delayed detection of spoilage conditions

* Poor coordination between warehouses and market demand

These inefficiencies lead to:

* Post-harvest losses

* Reduced farmer income

* Supply chain disruptions

* Price volatility in markets

Despite the expansion of agricultural warehousing and cold storage networks, many facilities lack intelligent monitoring and optimization systems.

Challenge Statement Design a scalable and data-driven warehouse management framework that optimizes agricultural storage conditions, inventory tracking, and distribution planning to minimize post-harvest losses and improve supply chain efficiency.
